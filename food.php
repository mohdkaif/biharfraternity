								<h2 class="eventname">Litti Chokha</h2>
								<p>The lip-smacking taste of <strong>Litti Chokha</strong>, savoured by one and all, needs no introduction. It is your grand welcome to the food of Bihar, in all its ghee-dripping glory. It consists of wheat and sattu with spices, kneaded into round spicy balls, dipped in ghee. The texture of Litti along with the crunchy crust makes it a foodie’s delight. <strong>Chokha</strong> is prepared by mashing boiled vegetables (most common being potatoes, brinjal, tomatoes), adding spices and chopped onion, garlic etc and served with Litti as a complimentary delicacy.</p>

								<p>Sattu or fried gram flour forms a distinctive element of <strong>Bihari food and cuisine.</strong> The sattu is mixed with spices and filled in wheat dough balls, rolled and cooked with ghee on a hot plate to form sattu paratha which is also called <em>makuni.</em></p>

It is a unique Prasad, exclusive to Hanuman Mandir. The divine delicacy melts in your mouth leaving you ecstatically content.</p>
