								<h2 class="eventname">Chhau Dance Performance</h2>
								<p>Bihar is a land of rich culture and all of us have to agree to this. So far we have spoken about the handloom, cuisine, history and architecture of Bihar and in order to complete this list of things to do in Bihar, a dance performance needs to be added. Chhau is a genre of dance that can be seen Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand along with Bihar. The dance is mainly performed during festivals and the use of masks is done, Chhau demands a lot of physical strength as the dance moves are difficult and requires lot of flipping and jumping. A full-fledged entertaining performance, Chhau dance is a must-see in Bihar.</p>
