								<h2 class="eventname">Aryabhatta</h2>
								<p>Aryabhata(some time misspelled as ‘Aryabhatta’) was one of the first Indian mathematicians and astronomers belonging to the classical age. He was born in 476 BC in Tarenaga, a town in Bihar, India. It is however definite that he travelled to Kusumapara (modern day Patna) for studies and even resided there for some time. It is mentioned in a few places that Aryabhata was the head of the educational institute in Kusumapara. The University of Nalanda had an observatory in its premises so it is hypothesized that Aryabhata was the principal of the university as well. On the other hand some other commentaries mention that he belonged to Kerala.</p>
